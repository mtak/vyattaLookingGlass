#   VyattaLookingGlass - Looking glass for the vyatta routing suite
#
#   This web frontend is designed to provide looking glass style
#    functionality for the Vyatta routing suite. It uses SSH to connect
#    to the Vyatta server and then runs commands on it. The web frontend
#    is AJAX driven, for a smooth user experience.
#
#  Installation:
#   Create a new user account and keypair and install it on the Vyatta
#    router;
#    - $ ssh-keygen -t dsa
#    - When prompted, save the key somewhere safe 
#    - View the public key (the one without the .key extension) and copy
#       the long string to your clipbord. Do not copy the extra
#       "ssh-dss" and following <username>@<host>.
#
#    - Login to your Vyatta router and type the following commands:
#     - # configure
#     - # set system user <username> level operator
#     - # set system user <username> plaintext-password "a password is
#      required for vyatta, but we're not going to use it, type gibberish"
#     - # set system user <username> public-keys <username>@<host> key
#      <paste your key>
#     - # set system user <username> public-keys <username>@<host> type
#      ssh-dss
#     - # commit
#     - # save
#
#   If you have trouble installing the key, refer to the Vyatta
#    documentation or check the Vyatta forums
#
#   Upload the files to your webserver. Perform the following steps:
#    - Enable CGI in your webserver (Apache: +ExecCGI, check your docs)
#    - Make the LookingGlass.pl file executable
#    - Put the private key file (which you create in the first step, with
#    the .key extension), in a directory that is accessible by the 
#    webserver, but NOT by remote users (so don't put it in the 
#    DocumentRoot). If you put the keyfile in a web-accessible directory 
#    you can compromise your system's security!!!
#
#   Update the following variables in the LookingGlass.pm script:
#    - my $routeserver = 'hostname.or.ip.of.your.vyatta.box';
#    - my $user = 'username';
#    - my $keyFile = '/path/to/your/private/key.key'; 
#
#   If you installed everything correctly, you should be able to accesst
#    he looking glass at http://yourwebserver.com/index.html. You can
#    test the looking glass by performing an nslookup query to for
#    example, www.example.com
#
#  Usage:
#   The looking glass provides a couple of functions. You can use it to
#    perform the following queries;
#    - BGP; this performs an 'show ip bgp $argument' command
#    - Traceroute; this does a traceroute the $argument ip
#    - Ping; this pings the $argument ip
#    - nslookup; does a dig to the $argument hostname
#    - AS; performs a 'show ip bgp regexp $argument' command
#
#  Dependencies/prerequisites:
#    - The client needs Javascript enabled
#    - Perl modules:
#     * CGI::Carp (apt-get install libcgi-pm-perl)
#     * CGI::Application (apt-get install libcgi-application-perl)
#
#  Troubleshooting:
#   Even though I try to make the code as stable as possible, there
#    might be a problem in the code. For debugging, you can check the
#    error log of the webserver. However, most of the time it's more
#    useful to check the error generated by CGI::Carp. In order to see
#    the error, you need to fake a request to the backend. This can be
#    done in the following way:
#   Browser to:
#    http://yourwebserver.com/LookingGlass.pl?qt=QT&arg=ARG
#   Where you can replace:
#    - QT: replace it with the qt of the query, which can be found in the
#     html (input radio buttons, value parameter), or the id of the
#     button
#    - ARG: The argument given in the textbox
#   For example:
#    http://yourwebserver.com/LookingGlass.pl?qt=ping&arg=1.2.3.4
#
#  Hacking:
#    - The title and header of the page can be easily edited to show
#     your own text. Edit the strings at line 21 and 72. You can use the
#     <h1> tag for big letters.
#
#    - In the LookingGlass.css file, you can change the background and
#    box colors. Look for #888888 for the background and for #bobfbe for
#    the box color. The box color is set multiple times!
#
#    - If you're a perl monk, you can also add your own function to the
#     LookingGlass application:
#     - The runmode is set by the qt POST variable. The POST variable is
#      set by the radio buttons in the HTML page.
#     - You can add another runmode to the LG around line 43
#     - If you need an IP address as input, use the ipLookupArg function
#     - If you need a hostname as input, use the getArg function
#     - You can use the runSsh() function to run the command
#     - Make sure your runmode returns the text you want displayed in
#      the #output box
